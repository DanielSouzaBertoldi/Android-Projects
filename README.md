# Android Projects

This is my personal repo. I'll be updating it while I create some apps in Android, both in Kotlin and Java.

All of these codes are just demonstrations of Android capabilities. They go from simple stuff like printing "Hello World!" to more advance stuff like how to deal with databases, background services and there's even apps that are clones of popular apps, like Uber. Feel free to check it all out if you want :)

## Installation

Clone this repo with ```git clone```, then move the project folder of your preference to your ```/AndroidStudioProjects/``` folder. Then, just open it with AndroidStudio or your preferred IDE for Android Development. Then just build the app!
